  # TODO: fill in your actual stack and conventions
  # Tech stack: e.g. TypeScript, React, Node.js / Unity, C# / Python, Django
  # Architecture: e.g. MVC, HMVC, ECS, Redux, MVVM, microservices
  # Testing: e.g. Jest, NUnit, pytest
  # Key constraints: e.g. legacy codebase, must support IE11, no breaking API changes

rules:
  proposal:
    - Always include a rollback plan for legacy code changes
    - List all affected modules
    - Always include an "## Alternatives Considered" section listing at least 2 alternative approaches with their pros, cons, and reason for rejection. Format each as: "### Option: <name> / Pros: ... / Cons: ... / Why rejected: ..."
  specs:
    - Use Given/When/Then format for scenarios
  design:
    - Respect existing legacy constraints
  tasks:
    - Keep tasks atomic (max 2-3 files per task)
    - After all tasks complete, run /opsx:verify
