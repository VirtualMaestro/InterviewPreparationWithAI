# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-Powered Interview Preparation Application is a comprehensive single-page web application that leverages OpenAI's GPT models to provide personalized interview preparation assistance. The application helps job seekers prepare for various types of interviews by generating customized questions, providing strategic preparation advice, and offering real-time feedback with transparent cost tracking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Question Generation System

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to input a job description and receive personalized interview questions, so that I can prepare effectively for my specific target role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a job description THEN the system SHALL validate the input for security and length constraints
2. WHEN a user selects an interview type (Technical, Behavioral, Case Studies, Questions for Employer) THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate questions for that category
3. WHEN a user specifies their experience level (Junior, Mid-level, Senior, Lead) THEN the system SHALL adjust question difficulty accordingly
4. WHEN questions are generated THEN the system SHALL provide 1-20 questions based on user preference with a default of 5
5. IF the job description is empty or invalid THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2: Advanced Prompt Engineering Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want access to different AI prompt techniques, so that I can get varied and high-quality question generation approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating questions THEN the system SHALL support all 5 prompt engineering techniques: Few-Shot Learning, Chain-of-Thought, Zero-Shot, Role-Based, and Structured Output
2. WHEN using Few-Shot Learning THEN the system SHALL provide examples to guide AI responses with appropriate difficulty patterns
3. WHEN using Chain-of-Thought THEN the system SHALL implement step-by-step reasoning process for question generation
4. WHEN using Role-Based prompts THEN the system SHALL adopt specific interviewer personas (strict, friendly, neutral)
5. WHEN using Structured Output THEN the system SHALL return JSON-formatted responses with question metadata
6. WHEN a user selects a prompt technique THEN the system SHALL apply the corresponding template and methodology

### Requirement 3: Real-time Cost Tracking and Transparency

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the cost of each API call in real-time, so that I can manage my OpenAI API usage and budget effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN questions are generated THEN the system SHALL calculate and display input token cost, output token cost, and total cost
2. WHEN displaying costs THEN the system SHALL show costs accurate to 6 decimal places in USD
3. WHEN multiple sessions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain a running total of cumulative costs
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL track and display token usage (input and output tokens)
5. IF pricing information is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4: Security and Input Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust security measures in place, so that the application is protected from malicious inputs and prompt injection attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs text THEN the system SHALL validate input length (maximum 5000 characters, minimum 10 characters)
2. WHEN processing user input THEN the system SHALL scan for and block prompt injection patterns
3. WHEN malicious content is detected THEN the system SHALL reject the input with appropriate error messages
4. WHEN sanitizing input THEN the system SHALL remove HTML/script tags and dangerous content
5. IF input validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about what needs to be corrected

### Requirement 5: Rate Limiting and API Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to manage API rate limits automatically, so that I don't encounter unexpected service interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL enforce a rate limit of 100 calls per hour
2. WHEN the rate limit is exceeded THEN the system SHALL display the remaining time until reset
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts maximum)
4. WHEN rate limits are approaching THEN the system SHALL display remaining call count
5. IF API calls consistently fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 6: Session Management and History

**User Story:** As a user, I want to track my interview preparation sessions, so that I can review previous questions and monitor my preparation progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN questions are generated THEN the system SHALL save the session with timestamp, interview type, and results
2. WHEN viewing session history THEN the system SHALL display up to 10 recent sessions
3. WHEN a session is saved THEN the system SHALL include cost information and question count
4. WHEN clearing results THEN the system SHALL allow users to reset the current display
5. IF session storage fails THEN the system SHALL continue functioning without breaking the user experience

### Requirement 7: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive and responsive interface, so that I can efficiently configure my preferences and view results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL display a clean single-page interface with clear sections
2. WHEN configuring settings THEN the system SHALL provide advanced options in an expandable section
3. WHEN questions are being generated THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators and status messages
4. WHEN results are ready THEN the system SHALL display questions, recommendations, and cost metrics in organized sections
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and optional debug information

### Requirement 8: OpenAI API Integration and Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless integration with OpenAI's latest models, so that I can leverage the most advanced AI capabilities for question generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the application THEN the system SHALL support GPT-4o and GPT-5 models
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use configurable temperature, max tokens, and other parameters
3. WHEN API keys are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup instructions
4. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL parse both structured JSON and plain text outputs
5. IF API integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and recovery suggestions
